Whenever people ask me the best way to get started in research my answer is always email. 
Email is a useful tool, but can cause you problems later on.
In this repository I will share drafts of bad and good emails, as well as how to know when to reach out to falculty.

First, I always reccomend using your school provided email when messaging faculty within the same school. This helps them know who you are. 
   Introduce yourself: Even if you have talked in person I would always start my first email with an introduction to myself and how the faculty member knows me. 
     Example: 
           Hello Dr. Hawkins, 
              My name is Jane Goodall and I am in your Introduction to Genetics class. 
              
Second, I get right to the point of why I am emailing them. 
     Example: 
             I am emailing you today to discuss a possibility of working as an undergraduate researcher. 
             
Third, make it personal. Show the faculty what you are intrested in and use examples. 
     Example: 
              I really enjoyed your lecture on ________ and noticed you also disscussed your similar research project _________. 
              
Fourth, conclude in a polite way and allow them to reach back out to schedule a time to meet.
     Example: 
              Let me know if you are available to meet in person and discuss possible options. 
                    Thank you for your time, 
                    Jane Goodall

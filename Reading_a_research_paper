When learning to read a research paper for the first time it can be overwhelming. 
HOW TO FIND A RESEACH PAPER:
    I would reccomend using Google Scholar as the souce of your papers. 
    Seach "Google Scholar" in Google
    Search for the topic you are intrested in Google Scholar
    For example is you search "Mechanisms of adaptation in a predator-prey arms race" the first article to pop up should be "Mechanisms of adaptation in a predator-prey arms race: TTX-resistant sodium channels" by S Geffeney
    This is a great read and we will be working through it together here. 
    SAVE TO YOUR GOOGLE SCHOLAR LIBRARY:
        Google scholar has an awesome feature that allows you to save articles to a library
        I highly reccomend checking this out
READING THE PAPER:
    Sticking with the Newt article for our example here.
    First take notice of the Title, Year, Author, and Journal
        The Title, Year, and Author can be useful for finding more material later.
        The Journal can tell you how impactful the paper is.
        Journals are ranked on something called impact factor. 
        Nature and Science having some of the largest im pact factors.
        This is not always important, but good to notice.
    The important things to take away from our article is that there are four authors total, and it is Published in the journal Science. Science has an impact factor of 63.832.
    In an article you should see the following sections (and the include):
    ABSTRACT
      Summary of the entire article.
    INTRODUCTION
      Reason for the study, and introduces the study system.
    METHODS
      What actually happened in the study.
    RESULTS
      What are the important takeaways from the study.
    DISSCUSSION
      Summary, and future direction to take.
    You do NOT have to read the sections in this order.
      Ask your mentor if they have any reccomendations

If your university offers the chance to do a Thesis as an Undergrad, do it. 
You will learn so much and have clear guideline set by your institution.
However, if you do not have that option, reach out to faculty who are doing research projects
Check out the "Writing_an_email" repositore to take the first steps in finding a mentor.
You should look for a mentor who is an established faculty member and has time for undergraduate students. 
Read some of their research papers to see if what they are doing is intresting.
Check out the "Reading_a_research_paper" repositore to learn more.
When you have a meeting with them make sure to discuss the expected project, and timeline of completion.
I would highly reccomend discussing work hour expectations, so both parties are aware of the commitment.
Next up is lit review.
You will be expected to read research papers that are about your project published both by your mentor, and others. 
Dont be afraid if it gets a little overwhelming, you are going to absorb a lot of information, but it is okay!
Always write down intresting things you can apply to your work, as well as questions you have.

As always show up and have fun.
